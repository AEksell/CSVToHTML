# CSVToHTML
Turn your CSV file into HTML Code or paste it directly into an empty HTML website.

If you want to convert CSV files directly into CODE to put on websites, use the python program. You will need to have a CSV file beforehand and cannot make them inside the program itself, but you can make as many tables as you please.

If you want to convert CSV files to visible tables on a website to screenshot, use the website which turns CSV files into styled tables, note that there is no diagram option and it only accepts CSV files.
